🚀 Event Management App
This project is a web application for event management and attendance registration, developed using [Your Framework, e.g., React, Vue, Vanilla JS] and with assistance from GitHub Copilot.

🛠️ Summary of GitHub Copilot Assistance
GitHub Copilot was strategically used to accelerate the creation of repetitive code and boilerplate, fulfilling the project requirements:

Foundational Component Structure (EventCard.js):

Copilot generated the basic structure of the EventCard component (JSX/HTML) and suggested the necessary hooks for two-way data binding.

Routing Implementation (AppRouter.js):

It helped quickly configure the route skeleton (/events, /:id) for routing functionality.

Validation and Optimization (ValidationUtils.js):

It suggested the regular expressions and functions for input validation (e.g., email format and password length), which is key for performance optimization.

State Management (AuthContext.js):

It generated the boilerplate for the Authentication Context and the basic login and logout functions, essential for managing user sessions .
